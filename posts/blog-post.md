1. Have something to be grateful for.

You can’t be excited about your day if you are grumbling. You need to build an attitude of gratitude. To build it, find something to be grateful for and fill your mind with it.

2. Have something to look forward to.

Next, you should have something to look forward to during your day. For instance, when Bill Gates was asked about the one thing that most excites him to start his day, his answer was “learning new things.” That is the thing that he looks forward to.

3. Manage your energy.

While the two points above can help you start your day with enthusiasm, they might not be enough to sustain you throughout the day. For this, you need to manage your energy. This includes both your physical and mental energy. Even if you start your day well, without good energy management you would lose your enthusiasm.

## Be grateful for something, look forward to something, and manage your energy. Do these and you will be excited about your day.
